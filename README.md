# Product-matching
Using ML/DL techniques, match similar products from the Flipkart dataset with the Amazon dataset.


To gain insight into the most common unigrams in the Product Description, the distribution of products and brands across the various Product Categories, an analysis of the length of the description, etc., a thorough analysis of the dataset was carried out using Word Clouds, Bar Graphs, TSNE Visualizations, etc.
Contraction Mapping, the elimination of personalised stopwords and URLs, tokenization, and lemmatization were carried out for data cleaning.


Descrimler: If you prefer something other than Python/R, please feel free to use that coding language.
The datasets shared are from free open data sources. We are not affiliated with Flipkart. The analysis submitted by you
will be used only for evaluation of your analytical skills and will not be published or shared anywhere.
